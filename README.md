# Advent of Code 2022

My Solutions to the Advent of Code 2022, I might not get them all done but I will try my best. 

## Blog

### [Day one](/01)

Easy enough solution, happy enough with it. Spent about twenty minutes on it.
Refined the solution a bit.

### [Day two](/02)

A bit of a pigs ear. It is a Friday night, had a day of meetings so my head is
scrambled. Spent about an hour on it. Got the answeres fairly quickly but
refined the solution too much. Diminishing returns I guess. This solution
didn't feel as clean as it should.

### [Day three](/03)

I didn't get to the puzzle on the 3rd, instead doing it on the 4th (a Sunday).
Actually solved while at my Mum's house watching some awful reality tv show.
Maybe it is my mood but in this one I didn't really think about the premise in
terms of elves and how the puzzle was framed. Instead I took it on the minimal
terms given. Therefore it was more academic than fun. Hopefully it was just my
mood.

I picked ruby for this one as I was in the mood for a little change.

I might get a chance to catch up later in the week but for now I am going to be
one day ahead.

### SICKNESS

I got Covid over the weekend, which makes sense as to the lacklustre attempt 
on [Day three](/03). During this time of convalescence I wont attempt any
puzzles. I will hopefully pick it up after.

### GETTING BACK TO IT

So I have been sick for the past week. I have recovered now to a point where I
can think straight again. As a result I will start to try and solve these problems
tomorrow. I doubt I'll get cauvht up in time though but you never know. Time will
tell I guess.
