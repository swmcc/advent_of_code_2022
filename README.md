My Solutions to the Advent of Code 2022, I might not get them all done but I will try my best.

### [Day one](/01)

Easy enough solution, happy enough with it. Spent about twenty minutes on it.
Refined the solution a bit.

### [Day two](/02)

A bit of a pigs ear. It is a Friday night, had a day of meetings so my head is
scrambled. Spent about an hour on it. Got the answeres fairly quickly but
refined the solution too much. Diminishing returns I guess. This solution
didn't feel as clean as it should.
